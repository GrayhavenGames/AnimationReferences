These are reference images I am using for 2d Animation

Process:
1. Create a 3d character model in Unreal.
2. Apply the animation to the character, and have it play with the desired camera angle.
3. Take screenshots of the desired number of frames in unreal engine.
5. Import image sequences as animation into Aseprite.
6. Change sprite height to 96, lock aspect ratio.
7. Change canvas size to 128 x 128
8. Change layer opacity to 128, then trace over it to create the animation.
